        This command is typically not necessary to execute, since the CircleCI convenience images
        ship with all licenses accepted.
        This command will add approximately 10 seconds to the build time.
      # Use a custom shell.
      # We don't `set -o pipefail` since sdkmanager does not interact nicely
      # with the incoming pipe, which can result in the `yes` command exiting with code 147.
      command: |
        yes | sdkmanager --licenses
        yes | sdkmanager --update
