  An example of using the more granular commands of the orb together,
  to achieve something similar to using the "start-emulator-and-run-tests" command
  or the "run-ui-tests" job.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    android: circleci/android@2.0
  jobs:
    test:
      executor:
        name: android/android-machine
        tag: "2021.10.1"
        resource-class: large
      steps:
        - checkout
        # Create an AVD named "myavd"
        - android/create-avd:
            avd-name: myavd
            system-image: system-images;android-29;default;x86
            install: true
        # By default, after starting up the emulator, a cache will be restored,
        # "./gradlew assembleDebugAndroidTest" will be run and then a script
        # will be run to wait for the emulator to start up.
        # Specify the "post-emulator-launch-assemble-command" command to override
        # the gradle command run, or set "wait-for-emulator" to false to disable
        # waiting for the emulator altogether.
        - android/start-emulator:
            avd-name: myavd
            no-window: true
            restore-gradle-cache-prefix: v1a
        # Runs "./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest" by default.
        # Specify the "test-command" parameter to customize the command run.
        - android/run-tests
        - android/save-gradle-cache:
            cache-prefix: v1a
  workflows:
    test:
      jobs:
        - test
