  using most of the default parameters.
  Parameters like the system_image and emulator options (e.g. "no_window")
  may need to be adjusted from the defaults, according to your project.

      jobs:
        - android/run_ui_tests:
            # Specify job "pre-steps" and "post-steps" if necessary
            # to execute custom steps before and afer any of the built-in steps
