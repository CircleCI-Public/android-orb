  A simple example of using the start-emulator-and-run-tests command
  in a job, using most of the default parameters.
  Parameters like the system-image and emulator options (e.g. "no-window")
  may need to be adjusted from the defaults, according to your project.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    android: circleci/android@1.0
  jobs:
    test:
      executor:
        name: android/android-machine
        resource-class: large
      steps:
        - checkout
        # Creates an AVD and starts up the emulator using the AVD.
        # While the emulator is starting up, the gradle cache will
        # be restored and the Android app will be assembled.
        # When the emulator is ready, UI tests will be run.
        # After the tests are run, the gradle cache will be saved (if it
        # hasn't been saved before)
        - android/start-emulator-and-run-tests:
            system-image: system-images;android-29;default;x86
        #   The cache prefix can be overridden
        #   restore-gradle-cache-prefix: v1a
        #
        #   The command to be run, while waiting for emulator startup, can be overridden
        #   post-emulator-launch-assemble-command: ./gradlew assembleDebugAndroidTest
        #
        #   The test command can be overridden
        #   test-command: ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
