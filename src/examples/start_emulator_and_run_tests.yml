  A simple example of using the start_emulator-and-run_tests command
  in a job, using most of the default parameters.
  Parameters like the system_image and emulator options (e.g. "no_window")
  may need to be adjusted from the defaults, according to your project.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    android: circleci/android@2.4.0
  jobs:
    test:
      executor:
        name: android/android_machine
        tag: "default"
        resource_class: large
      steps:
        - checkout
        # Creates an AVD and starts up the emulator using the AVD.
        # While the emulator is starting up, the gradle cache will
        # be restored and the Android app will be assembled.
        # When the emulator is ready, UI tests will be run.
        # After the tests are run, the gradle cache will be saved (if it
        # hasn't been saved before)
        - android/start_emulator_and_run_tests:
            system_image: system_images;android-29;default;x86
        #   The cache prefix can be overridden
        #   restore_gradle_cache_prefix: v1a
        #
        #   The command to be run, while waiting for emulator startup, can be overridden
        #   post_emulator_launch_assemble_command: ./gradlew assembleDebugAndroidTest
        #
        #   The test command can be overridden
